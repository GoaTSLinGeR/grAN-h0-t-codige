# About Us

## Who We Are

We're the bridge between ambitious first-time business owners and the banks that actually want to work with them.

If you've ever been rejected for business banking because you don't have "two years of tax returns" or "established business credit," you know the frustration. Traditional banks treat startups like risky bets. But you're not risky—you're just getting started.

That's where we come in.

## Our Story

Founded by entrepreneurs who faced the same brick walls you're facing now, we built this service because we got tired of watching talented business owners waste weeks—sometimes months—applying to banks that were never going to say yes.

We asked a simple question: What if someone actually knew which banks welcome new businesses, and could match you with the right one from day one?

That question became our mission.

## What We Do

We connect first-time small business owners with banks that specialize in startups and new ventures. No more guessing. No more generic "best banks" lists written by people who've never started a business.

Here's how we're different:

**We Pre-Qualify You**: Before you ever fill out an application, we make sure you match the bank's actual requirements—not the marketing fluff on their website.

**We Know the Real Requirements**: We maintain direct relationships with startup-friendly banks and know exactly what they're looking for. No surprises. No hidden dealbreakers.

**We Save You Time**: The average first-time business owner applies to 3-5 banks before approval. Our customers average 1.2 applications. That's 15-20 hours of your life back.

**We Educate, Not Just Match**: You'll understand what banks look for, why you were matched with specific options, and how to maintain a strong banking relationship as you grow.

## Our Promise

We only recommend banks where you have an 85%+ approval probability. If you're rejected at a bank we recommended, we refund your service fee. That's how confident we are in our matching process.

We don't take kickbacks that influence our recommendations. If a bank pays us for successful placements, that's disclosed. Our loyalty is to you—the entrepreneur trying to build something real.

## Who We Serve

- Solo founders launching their first business
- Service professionals going independent (consultants, contractors, designers)
- E-commerce entrepreneurs moving from hobby to business
- Retail startups looking for merchant services
- Any first-time business owner tired of being told "no"

We work with businesses across all 50 states, from rural Louisiana to urban California. If you're starting a legitimate business and need banking, we can help.

## The Team

We're a small, focused team of former entrepreneurs, banking professionals, and customer advocates who believe every business owner deserves a fair shot at financial services.

We've been in your shoes. We know what it's like to have your LLC paperwork in hand but no bank account to deposit your first payment. We built this service to make sure no entrepreneur has to face that frustration alone.

## Ready to Find Your Bank?

Stop applying blindly. Let us match you with a bank that's actually ready to say yes.
